# project-Text-and-face-detection-in-images-
I used the python tesseract (py-tesseract) library with Python 3  to detect text images through optical character recognition (OCR) and the Python imaging library (pillow) to open, view, and manipulate images, including cropping, resizing, recoloring, and overlaying text.  
and  used the open source computer vision library (OpenCV) to detect faces.
